This is a project made in two weeks for educational purposes. It was kinda fun to do though. We were just beginning coding so it's not optimized.

This is a link to our Trello RoadMap:

The game is inspired in mediaeval and magic stories already existing. The story is that of a prince who needs to grow to inherit his father's position to rule the whole kingdom.
Hence, he enrolls in the castle's guard anonymously and needs to fight to gain experience and recognition. He has many fighting possibilities: the training and tournament present in the castle's barracks, and the arena or missions outside the city.
In the castle's barracks, he can fight against other guards, and outside the city, against other (and true) enemies.

The player can also access to a merchant to buy or sell items (the merchant receives new items every 5 minutes passed since the last visit) and a blacksmith to craft equipments used to boost his strength. There's also a hidden feature to recycle equipment the player possesses. It's available when going to the market and accessing the inventory: there, the normally "Jeter" option turns into "Recycler" and it allows the player to retreive the most pricy ingredient used to craft the recycled item.

Another special feature is an item (different for each race the player chooses) that let him gain stats by simply using it from the inventory.

IMPORTANT NOTE: for a better experience, we advise you to change the font size of your terminal.

To play in the non built executable version, you just need to open a terminal in the exec folder and write : go run ./main.go
Good luck!

Hope you enjoy the game!
